JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll serve
```

---

## Project structure

This is the directory structure of the project:

```other
jekyll-rapid-styleguide/
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts
â”œâ”€â”€ _sass
â”œâ”€â”€ _site
â””â”€â”€ assets
    â”œâ”€â”€ css
    â”œâ”€â”€ fonts
    â”œâ”€â”€ img
    â””â”€â”€ js
```

#### What are these folders?

- **\_includes** - contain partials and reusable components
- **\_layouts** - contain the different site layouts. Currently only the default layout is used.
- **\_sass** - here you can find the separate style files of each component and partial
- **\_site** - jekyll builds (or serve) the project's output in this folder.
- **assets** - containing the assets of the site, nicely separated in relevant folders

---

## Configuration

As in every Jekyll project, the base configuration file is `_config.yml` in the project's root folder. Feel free to open it in your text editor and customize the basic details of the site:

```yaml
title: Jekyll Sharp StyleGuide
tagline: A styleguide template in Jekyll.
description: A fresh, lightweight custom built styleguide template in Jekyll.
author: ErikTailor
locale: en
```

> > You can obviously modify other settings in the configuration file as well, however it's not needed for a typical usuage, as these settings cover the best setup for usuage of this styleguide template.

---

## Customize favicon

Favicon (or site icon) is the tiny picture near the tab title of your website in a browser. If you have your custom image ready, go to the [favicon generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) and select your image. Customize the settings if needed, and make sure that the last setting **Favicon Generator Options** is set for locate favicons from a custom path (instead of project root) and enter `/assets/img/favicons` as a path. Finally download the generated package, and replace the original favicons in the project.

---

## Customize variables

To modify the visual elements of the styleguide template, you have to adjust a the style setting variables in `_sass/_variables.scss` file. Open it up in your text editor, and customize it.

### Options

| `Colors`      | Change the [theme color](https://eriktailor.github.io/jekyll-sharp-styleguide/#colors) variablees     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Fonts`       | Change the [font family](https://eriktailor.github.io/jekyll-sharp-styleguide/#headings) of the theme |
| `Headings`    | Set the size of the [headings](https://eriktailor.github.io/jekyll-sharp-styleguide/#paragraphs)      |
| `Radius`      | Set the global border radius value                                                                    |
| `Breakpoints` | The responsive breakpoints, where layout changes                                                      |
| `Spacer`      | Spacer is a global variable used to define the spacing between elements.                              |

---

## Assets

Every asset of the site is located in the `assets` folder. You can:

- add / modify images in the **img** folder
- add / modify local hosted fonts in the **fonts** folder
- add / modify javascript files in the **js** folder. If you want to add a new script file to the project, you need to include it in the **js** folder, and call for it in the `_includes/scripts.html` file.
- do not use the **css** folder at all, as it grabs the output of the stylings in the **\_sass** folder

---

## Working with includes

The site partials and reusable components are located in the `_includes` folder. You can always add / modify / remove any of the files, according to the usuage of [Jekyll Includes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/) as in the original documentation.

### Example

Let's say that you want to add a tagline below the site title in the hero section. To do this, you have to edit the `_includes/header.html` partial, by adding the following code below the `<h1>` tag:

```html
<h1>{{ site.title }}</h1>
<h2>My amazing tagline</h2>
```

Save the file, and head to the frontend of your site at `http://localhost:4000` address. You will see, that the new tagline has been nicely added in the header:

> > **Note:** when you removing an include file, make sure to delete every instances where that include was called, or you will get a Jekyll error in building. So assume you delete **image.html** partial, then you have to delete these everywhere in the project.

---

## Modifying styles

If you are familiar with [Sass syntax](https://sass-lang.com/), you can easily modify a component's style in it's `.scss` file. Every component is in a separate file, so you will probably find the element part you are looking for.

### Example

For example, you want to change the background color of the button component to black. Open the `_sass/buttons.scss` file, and change the **background-color** attribute's value to dark:

```css
.btn {
    background: $dark;
...
```

After the build (or serve), if you go to the frontend, you will see that the button's background changed according to your modification made:

![Image.png](https://res.craft.do/user/full/34d81fee-a2e7-021c-d5fc-2e46d6c760cb/doc/E052B4B3-0E45-4588-A5E1-0559D6FDBE22/71628610-C137-455B-AD39-9FCA8B387E03_2/yxNBMNj2TWwdtpdQpEpMZvgvk1LRhmTnolZchgc4Gpsz/Image.png)

> > Feel free to edit each `.scss` file to achieve the expected custom layout imagined for your website.

## Helper classes

The concept was to make available a couple of `css` helper classes in head of the most quick development / customizing workflow. The base idea is that you not neeed to write css code every time you want to do a minor adjustment for example, just use the classes on the element you want to style, and achieve the expected result with less time spent.

### Example

Let's say, you want to add a bigger bottom spacing to an element. The usual way would be to target the element with a class or id, and write a css code to achieve the requested spacing, like:

```css
#mydiv {
  margin-bottom: 50px;
}
```

Instead of this, you can just add the `mb-5` class (which is 50px margin to the bottom) to to the element, and get the expected result immediately, without need to write a line of code.

### Margin & Padding

The template has a few helper classes for adjusting the target's margin or padding values. The basic syntax is formatted like `<property><direction>-<size>`.

- **property:** it can be `m` for margin, and `p` for padding
- **direction:**
  - `t` for top
  - `e` for right (end)
  - `b` for bottom
  - `s` for left (start)
- **distance**:
  - `1` for 10px
  - `2` for 20px
  - `3` for 30px
  - `4` for 40px
  - `5` for 50px

Actually this is the exact same method what [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/utilities/spacing) uses for spacing helpers. So to grab things together, let's say you want to add a left padding of 30px to an element. Just add the class `ps-3` .

```css
.ps-3
  <padding
  > <start
  > -<30px
  > .mt-1
  <margin
  > <top
  > -<10px
  > .pb-5
  <padding
  > <bottom
  > -<50px
  > .me-4
  <margin
  > <end
  > -<40px
  >;
```

### Colors

About painting, we will cover two types:

\*Â coloring a background

\*Â coloring a text

### Background color

The syntax would be the following: `.bg-<color>`. Colors can be these by default:

- **accent**: #2AAB7B
- **dark**: #17100F
- **light**: #F6F5F5
- **white**: #FFFFFF

```css
.bg-accent {
  background-color: $accent;
}
.bg-white {
  background-color: $white;
}
```

### Text color

The syntax is: `.text-<color>`. You can use the colors mentioned above. So let's see examples:

```css
.text-dark {
  color: $dark;
}
.text-white {
  color: $white;
}
```

### Opacity

It works like this: `.opacity-<number>`. Numbering is by tens, if it's lower, the opacity of the element is as low as that value:

```css
.opacity-70 {
  opacity: 0.7;
}
.opacity-20 {
  opacity: 0.2;
}
```

### Display

The last one is making the display css attribute easier to implement. The syntax is `.d-<value>` .

- **none**: don't display at all
- **block**: display as block
- **inline-block**: display as an inline block
- **inline**: display as an inline elemenet

```css
.d-block {
  display: block;
}
.d-none {
  display: none;
}
```

> > **Note**: You will find the sources of these helper classses in the `_sass/_helpers.scss` file.

---

## Editing layouts

In this styleguide template I only use a single layout, the default one at `_layouts/default.html`.

You have to edit this file if you may want to:

- edit the `<head>` contents
- modify the wrapper elements of the main content
- add / remove lightbox, page loader, header, footer, etc.
- add scripts manually to the bottom of the page

> > **Note**: You are always free to create as many layouts as you need, according to [Jekyll's layout](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/04-layouts/) documentation for more information on using layouts.

---

## Deploy your site

When you feel ready, and satisfied with the result, you may want to deploy the project to a website. If you planning to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can find a [great tutorial](https://eriktailor.github.io/blog/use-any-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/) on this written by me.
